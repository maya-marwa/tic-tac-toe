Steps to creating my tic-tac-toe game :))



- tried to use the event.target more frequently in the functions I created but there were many mistakes in my code, I felt like I couldn't get it to work and had to delete all my code at least a couple of times lol

- I set up html tags for 9 cells which I orgininally names turns then changes to cells after doing a google search. I kept changing from ids to classes as I thought I might need to be more specific. I ended using using both (I didn't know you could do that) but didn't really need ids in the end.

- I created a box which I also renamed to container to hold the cells, made so many changes on css then decided to keep it simple.

- I thought about the different ways of winning the game = 8 and created an array.

- I did a lot of googling! I also watched a coupd of tutorials on you tube - I found it interesting to see the different ways you can build the game but also some things confused me.. 

- I played around with css a lot then opted for a simple look.
